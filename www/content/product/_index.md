## How VeilVault Works

VeilVault uses cryptographic proofs to verify financial records are complete, accurate, and untampered. No trust required - just math.

### Core Features

#### Transaction Ledger
Every transaction recorded in an append-only Merkle tree. Any tampering is mathematically detectable within seconds.

#### Audit Packages
Generate audit-ready packages that external auditors can verify independently - without needing access to your raw data.

#### Real-Time Dashboard
Live integrity status across all systems. Instant alerts if anything changes unexpectedly.

#### Customer Verification
Let your customers independently verify their own account statements are accurate and complete.

### Advanced Features

#### Zero-Knowledge Solvency Proofs
Prove "Assets > Liabilities" without revealing actual numbers. Publish monthly proofs your customers can verify.

#### Multi-Party Ceremonies
Critical operations require cryptographic sign-off from multiple parties. No single person can falsify records.

#### Regulatory Reporting
Auto-generate Basel III, SOX, and other compliance reports with built-in cryptographic verification.

VeilVault is powered by the VeilSuite cryptographic stack:

- **VeilChain** - Immutable Merkle tree ledger
- **VeilProof** - Zero-knowledge proofs (Groth16/PLONK)
- **VeilKey** - Threshold cryptography
- **VeilSign** - Privacy-preserving credentials
- **VeilCloud** - Scalable infrastructure (Kafka, Citus)
